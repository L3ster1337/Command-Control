# Command-Control

A basic Poc for Command and Control after exploring AD's.

First thing you have to deal is to find valid credentials into the system. After that, you're going to be able to explore different scenarios manipulating
network traffic and stuff.
I'd trust you to use with a cool threads numbers, once it's going to be quick like that. Change the USERNAME and PASSWORD inside the code, I'm using Bandit0 from
OverTheWire to make tests, READ THE CODE FIRST.

You can improve it by yourself and use those simple lines if you can't wget Crackmapexec or make proxy tunnels directly.

That's all folks :)
