# Command-Control

A basic Poc for Command and Control after exploring AD's.

First thing you have to deal is to find valid credentials into the system. After that, you're going to be able to explore different scenarios manipulating
network traffic and stuff.
I'd trust you to use with Interlace, considering a cool threads number, once it's going to be quickly like that.

Change the USERNAME and PASSWORD inside the code! I'm using Bandit0 from OverTheWire to make tests, so READ THE fucking damn CODE.

You can improve it by yourself and use those simple lines if you failed 'wgetting' Crackmapexec or making proxy tunnels.

That's all folks :)
